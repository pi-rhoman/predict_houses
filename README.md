# Fortran House Price Predictor
This is a program that uses linear regression to predict the price of a house based on it's floor area and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms it has.

It was developed as a simple project to learn Fortran90.
## Usage
The dataset must be in the form of a .csv file with colums for floor area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and price in that order.

Call the program with
./myregression \<dataset name> 

You will then be prompted to enter values for the house you want to predict.
